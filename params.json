{"name":"Torch Framework","tagline":"An IoC Framework driven by an AngularJS web front-end","body":"### Why Torch Framework\r\nWith the Torch Framework you are in control of every aspect of your web application. A distinct separation of concerns has been implemented between the Front-End, the API and even the Model Layer. Feel free to remove the PHP ActiveRecord and implement Laravel's Eloquent ORM or any other ORM for that matter. You also have the ability to modify the data storage method with little effort.\r\n\r\nThe Torch Framework is a minimalistic approach to web applications. The idea is that you can spend some time designing your front end using a web application framework like Polymer. Once you have a desire to hook that web application to a centralized server-system which will allow data storage and user interaction, simply implement the Torch Framework with the models and corresponding controllers and you are finished.\r\n\r\n### What is the Torch Framework\r\nAs stated it is an IoC Framework driven by AngularJS. Angular is not necessarily required. The user is easily able to remove the AngularJS parts and use some other framework like Polymer or BackboneJS.\r\n\r\nAs a user of the Torch Framework you are expected to be familiar with HTTP Request verbs. Specifically POST, PUT, GET and DELETE. These methods directly correspond within the framework with Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT) and Delete also known as CRUD operations. Using the server to verify permissions to specific operations your web front-end only needs to assume the user has the rights and make the request. The server will then decide if that request is valid and respond to the client accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe Torch Framework was built in 2014 due to a need that Benjamin Payne (@trixtur) had to have a back-end for a web application he was building. Since that time others have expressed interest in using the API framework and the Torch Framework project was born.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
